Socket programming
------------------
By using socket two application/program can communicate with each other.
In java programming every socket is represented in the form of object.
This object should be created from the class java.net.Socket

Client program will create this object first

Socket soc=new Socket("ip addres of the server",port_number_of_server);

Socket soc=new Socket("172.45.44.133",2009);

This code will send a request to the server
Server will accept this request and will create a scoket for the client at server side
By using these two sockets both client and server program will communicate with each other

Communication
-------------

1:Client program will write data into socket.This data will be sent to the server side socket
2:Server program will read data from the socket
3:Server program will generate response
4)Server program will write response into the socket.This response will be sent to the client side socket
5)Client program will read resposne from the socket
6)Client program will display the response

Note:As we know read and write operation is performed using stream.Every socket has both input stream(read) and output stream(write)  


ServerSocket class:Server program must create an object of this class on execution.
Following method of this class will be executed to accept client request

public Socket accept():On execution this will perform following tasks

1)It will accept client request
2)It will create and return object of Socket class.

Note:This method will be called when client program will create a socket(Object of socket class)
